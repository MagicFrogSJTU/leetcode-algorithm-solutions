# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,null,null,2]'
#
# Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
# 
# Recover the tree without changing its structure.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,3,null,null,2]
# 
# 1
# /
# 3
# \
# 2
# 
# Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
# 
# 3
# /
# 1
# \
# 2
#

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]
# 
# ⁠ 3
# ⁠/ \
# 1   4

# Follow up:
# 
# 
# A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.
# Could you devise a constant space solution?
