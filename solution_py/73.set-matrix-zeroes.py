# Testcase Example:  '[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]'
#
# Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.
# Do it in-place.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# [
# [1,1,1],
# [1,0,1],
# [1,1,1]
# ]
# Output: 
# [
# [1,0,1],
# [0,0,0],
# [1,0,1]
# ]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# [
# [0,1,2,0],
# [3,4,5,2],
# [1,3,1,5]
# ]
# Output: 
# [
# [0,0,0,0],
# [0,4,5,0],
# [0,3,1,0]
# ]

# Follow up:
# 
# 
# A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
# A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best
# solution.
# Could you devise a constant space solution?
